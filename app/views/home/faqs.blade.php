                            <p><strong>We feel security could be an issue, what if a user (student or organization) working remotely passes on information in an unauthorized manner?</strong></p>
                            <p>This is very unlikely for the following reasons</p>
                            <p><ol>
                                <li>We are very clear in our Terms of Service, sections 4.5, 6.2 and 6.3, that all confidential material will be handed over or destroyed. Any abuse of this will result in the immediate expulsion of the user. We will also pursue all further avenues (legal, university officials, organization leadership, Better Business Bureau, police, etc) so as to instill confidence in the marketplace.</li>
                                <li> We encourage all users to immediately bring to our attention any request for private information by an unauthorized person. If proven, it will result in swift action as described above</li>
                                <li>It is not in the interest of any user to share private information in an unauthorized fashion. By doing so, the user only loses trust with the person they think they are helping. For students starting out their careers, it’s too high of a risk. For organizations, the reward is too small</li>

                            <p><strong>Why are projects one week long?</strong></p>
                            <p>One week is long enough to realistically assess fit, and short enough to not be an excessive commitment for either the employee or student. Organizations and students are welcome to extend the relationship either via us or otherwise (we don’t require exclusivity).</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Is one week enforced?</strong></p>
                            <p>The initial expectation by market participants is one week. Organizations and students are welcome to extend the relationship if there’s a mutual fit.</p>

                            <p><strong>What if my project is longer than one week?</strong></p>
                            <p>The project could either be broken into smaller units, or you could have a team of students work on it simultaneously.</p>

                            <p>Rather than understand what you do, a student could help you understand what others are doing. Extensive syndicated research subscriptions and local market access are tools students have that you may not.</p>

                            <p>Talent sourcing and market research are two ongoing activities for your organization already. Don’t pay head hunters and research outfits tens of thousands of dollars to do it for you when you can get the best students in the world to help you instead.</p>

                            <p>You can find students from your country of choice. If you don’t find students in the country you’re looking for, post your listing and we’ll follow up ASAP.</p>

                            <p>We’ll give you access to not just those universities, but tens of others from around the world. Bring in fresh perspectives at a fraction of the recruiting and research cost you currently incur.</p>

                            <p>Working with <strong>SensiHub</strong> will bring those numbers down. Both you and the student have a good idea of what to expect from the other after one or multiple projects.</p>

                            <p> As a marketplace that creates opportunity, <strong>SensiHub</strong> believes in the change that education can bring not just to those that don’t have it, but to us all.

                            <p><strong>How many listings can an organization or student have?</strong></p>
                            <p>As many as you want. Each listing should be distinct though. For example, an organization could have separate listings for sales, research and technical types of roles. Similarly a student could have separate listings and tailor each to demonstrate interest in a particular sector or function.</p>
